Trump pulls invitation to NFL champions Eagles over anthem
Trump said in a statement late on Monday that the Eagles, who defeated the New England Patriots in the NFL’s Super Bowl in February, wanted to send a smaller delegation but that he declined. “They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country,” Trump said. Last season, some National Football League players took a knee during the anthem to protest police shootings of unarmed black men, sparking a controversy. The protests began in 2016 with former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Trump denounced the players as unpatriotic and repeatedly demanded an end to such protests. Under a policy unveiled last month by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and welcomed by Trump, teams will be fined if players on the field fail to stand during “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Players who choose not to stand may remain in the locker room until the anthem is finished. In his statement, Trump said the Eagles wanted to a send a smaller delegation, “but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better.” “These fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony - one that will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem,” Trump said. The Eagles did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Torrey Smith, who played as a wide receiver for the Eagles in the Super Bowl but has since been traded, responded on Twitter to Trump, saying that there were “so many lies.” “Not many people were going to go,” Smith said, and “no one refused to go simply because Trump ‘insists’ folks stand for the anthem.” Trump, he said, “continues to spread the false narrative that players are anti military.” Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania invited the team to visit the Capitol Building and called Trump’s action “a political stunt.”
